## Notes
### Github Notes - 23 Jan 2023
I learned how to use git and github together either through the terminal or vs code. I also learned how to merge conflicts and the basics of git. I personally prefer doing everything through vs code with GitLens.
The basics for using git and github are:
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (`git pull`)
1. Make changes to the code
1. Commit the changes (`git commit`)
1. Push the changes to GitHub (`git push`)

I still need to learn more about [markdown files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).
